How to use:

Open the terminal in the directory of midi and type ./midi

After you run wmidi.exe you should be prompted to enter a port number.

The program will let you know if you have any devices connected, and if so a list
of them with there port numbers will be shown

The next step is to enter the number of any of these ports (usually you will only have one)

If sucessfull it will let you know it is reading data and that to stop it press Ctrl-C

Once you are done playing your instrument there will be a data.txt file that stores all the MIDI information

***WARNING***

data.txt file is destroyed everytime you run the program

If you want to keep the data in data.txt rename the file
